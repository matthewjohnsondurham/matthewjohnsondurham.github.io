  <h1>Sutton Trust, August 2021: <br>How to find what you're looking for</h1>
 
<p>An activity taking a quick look at the science of networks including a short coding exercise studying a simple computational problem.

<p>We will go through everything on Zoom so all you need from here is the following file with the exercise <a href="ExerciseSuttonTrust2021.ipynb">ExerciseSuttonTrust2021.ipynb</a> and this <a href="handout.pdf">handout</a>.


<p>But if you want to go back over any part, you can read through this page.  The videos were made last year, but the content is essentially the same.  Below you can also find solutions to the exercise, and an additional exercise if you have time and want to carry on later.

<p>If you have any questions after the session, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:matthew.johnson2@durham.ac.uk">matthew.johnson2&#0064;durham.ac.uk</a>.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>A very brief introduction to the study of networks.  </p>

<p>Here is a link to the story behind the final slide: <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/01/slime-mold-grows-network-just-like-tokyo-rail-system/">Slime Mold Grows Network Just Like Tokyo Rail System</a>

<p>If you have time later, here is a longer introduction to <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/video/emergence-of-network-science">Network Science</a>.

<h3>How to find what you're looking for</h3>

<p>The background to the problem we will try to solve.  </p>

<iframe src="https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=7bcfd4d4-f217-4087-8d87-ac0200fc1a27&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&captions=false&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

<h3>Getting the code</h3>

<p>We will use the website <a href="https://cocalc.com">cocalc.com</a>  </p>

<p>Download the file <a href="ExerciseSuttonTrust2021.ipynb">ExerciseSuttonTrust2021.ipynb</a>

<p>Watch the video to see how to download the code and open it on the web.  (Note the file is a Jupyter Notebook.  If you are familiar with working with these, then you can choose to open it by some other means.)</p>


<iframe src="https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=9fe42914-d9be-4513-b838-ac0201093935&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&captions=false&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

<p>I gloss over this in the video, but I would strongly advise making an account on <a href="https://cocalc.com">cocalc.com</a> so that you don't lose your work.</p>

<p>There is no need to read it for the current exercise, but here is more comprehensive guidance: <a href="https://doc.cocalc.com/">What is CoCalc?</a></p>

<h3>Start working with the code</h3>


<p>Watch the video to see how to begin working with the code.  You will need to refer to this <a href="handout.pdf">handout</a>.</p>

<iframe src="https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=51a728cb-408b-44d0-b516-ac050082ad98&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&captions=false&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

<p>Ideally you would now work through the notebook, but if you get stuck at any stage or want to check your work, download the notebooks containing   partial solutions.

<h3>Solutions</h3>


<p>Below are notebooks that are completed up to and including each of the tasks.  Important note: if you use one of these notebooks and start working somewhere in the middle, the first thing you should do is go to the cell where you are going to start working and choose "Run all above" from the cell menu so that all the past work is redone.   
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="ExerciseSuttonTrust2021Task1.ipynb">Task1</a>
<li><a href="ExerciseSuttonTrust2021Task2.ipynb">Task2</a>
<li><a href="ExerciseSuttonTrust2021Task3.ipynb">Task3</a>
<li><a href="ExerciseSuttonTrust2021Task4.ipynb">Task4</a>
<li><a href="ExerciseSuttonTrust2021Task5.ipynb">Task5</a>

</ul>

<p>Finally (repeating the text at the end of the exercise): the algorithm described is Google's PageRank that uses the structure of the web to determine the quality of webpages (PageRank is just one of hundreds of procedures used to find search results).

<p>This article gives some more background:
<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/02/ff_google_algorithm/">http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/02/ff_google_algorithm/</a>

<p>What the exercise aimed to illustrate was how to we can approach a problem as Computer Scientists.  The problem is simple to state (what makes a node important) and we can quickly generate a simple answer (other nodes point to it), but when we look more carefully and try to implement our answer, the problem is revealed to be more complicated.  But, gradually, we can improve our answer and ultimately come up with what looks like a good solution.
